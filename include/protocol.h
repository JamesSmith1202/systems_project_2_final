Note on the in_chatroom field:

the client will not be in a chatroom initially

client will request to join one through the !join command
	if the in_chatroom field is == 0 in the response, the server did
	not add the client to the chat room
	
	if it is 1, then client has successfully joined the room

everytime the server sends a message to a client, the server should always
	specify whether or not the client is still in the room.

the client will assume it is no longer in a chat room if
	in_chatroom == 0
	
	at this point, the client should attempt to join a chatroom again
	with !join

if the client uses the !leave command, it is expected that the server will
	respond with in_chatroom == 0
